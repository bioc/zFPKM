Description: Perform the zFPKM transform on RNA-seq FPKM data. This
        algorithm is based on the publication by Hart et al., 2013
        (Pubmed ID 24215113). Reference recommends using zFPKM > -3 to
        select expressed genes. Validated with encode open/closed
        chromosome data. Works well for gene level data using FPKM or
        TPM. Does not appear to calibrate well for transcript level
        data.
